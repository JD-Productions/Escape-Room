Hello! This is a text-adventurwe game. You play by typing commands, like you did earlier. The standard commands are as follows:

To inspect something, type:
	inspect
	search
	examine
	x

To take something, type:
	take
	t

To unlock something, type:
	unlock
	u

To view items, type:
	inventory
	inv
	i

Those are the basic commands. That should be all.
Think logically, and remember, there's always a way!
I wish you good luck...
